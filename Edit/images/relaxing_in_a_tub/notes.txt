A luxurious bathtub filled with thick, soft foam, dimly lit by warm ambient lighting. A Royal Salute whiskey bottle elegantly placed on the edge of the tub, reflecting subtle golden highlights. The scene is intimate and romantic, with gentle candlelight reflections on the glossy marble surroundings. A cinematic, moody atmosphere with soft shadows and a rich color palette of deep blues, golds, and warm amber tones.
