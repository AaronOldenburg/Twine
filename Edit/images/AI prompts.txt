A 55-65-year-old man sitting on a couch in a cozy, well-lit living room. He has a smug, confident expression as if giving outdated advice. He is wearing a slightly snug polo shirt over a noticeable belly, arms crossed, leaning back comfortably. His posture suggests mild bloating or discomfort, subtly holding his stomach or slightly shifting in his seat. He is also hooked up to a dialysis machine - make it look visible but subtle. The scene looks like a natural, candid photograph with warm lighting, a slightly blurred background, and realistic depth of field. Make it photorealistic, high-resolution, and authentic-looking

"Hyper-realistic cinematic moment, grand medieval hall with towering stone arches and stained glass windows casting fractured light. Young warrior (Fatih, early 20s, conflicted expression) stands at the center, his father's bloodied dagger clutched in one hand, wearing a torn black tunic. Around him, dozens of hooded figures in vibrant, patterned cloaks (crimson, emerald, sapphire) kneel in submission, their heads bowed low, fabrics pooling like liquid paint. Dramatic upward camera angle emphasizing Fatih's solitude amidst the crowd, his face half-shadowed by light from a high window, eyes wide with shock and dawning authority. Symbolic details: his father's cracked emblem underfoot, a shattered hourglass on the throne steps, swirling cloak fabrics morphing into smoke at the edges. High contrast lighting, rich jewel tones clashing with ashen grays, hyper-detailed textures: sweat on skin, embroidered cloak threads, glinting dagger. Emotional tension between vulnerability and power, inspired by Renaissance fresco compositions."

An ultra-high-resolution DSLR-quality photograph of a professional therapist‚Äôs office, designed for Zoom. The setting features a warm, neutral-toned couch with soft fabric upholstery, placed against a subtly textured taupe or muted gray wall. The background wall includes a gentle design element--such as a faint abstract painting, softly blurred framed certificate, or subtle paneling--to add realism without distraction. The lighting is evenly diffused, casting a soft, warm ambiance with no harsh shadows or dramatic sunlight. A small wooden side table sits beside the couch, holding a single modern table lamp with a warm-toned shade, creating a cozy yet professional feel. The setting is uncluttered --no excessive decorations, no large bookshelves, and absolutely no windows--to ensure a clean and distraction-free background. Captured with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, 50mm f/2.8 lens, using natural bokeh and shallow depth of field to softly blur the background while keeping a crisp, professional aesthetic. No artificial reflections or bright highlights--just soft, ambient lighting to create a balanced and realistic therapy office environment. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 5.2 - @Sca

A group of students from diverse backgrounds gathered in front or inside the building, some sitting on walls and others standing around them as they share stories with each other.

In one corner there‚Äôs an open space where people can be seen playing games together. It seems to have been taken during summer when trees growing nearby cast long shadows over all who were present.
